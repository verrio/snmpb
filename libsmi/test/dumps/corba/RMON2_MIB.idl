    /*
             This TC describes an object that counts events with the
             following semantics: objects of this type will be set to
             zero(0) on creation and will thereafter count appropriate
             events, wrapping back to zero(0) when the value 2^32 is
             reached.
             
             Provided that an application discovers the new object within
             the minimum time to wrap, it can use the initial value as a
             delta since it last polled the table of which this object is
             part.  It is important for a management station to be aware of
             this minimum time and the actual time between polls, and to
             discard data if the actual time is too long or there is no
             defined minimum time.
             
             Typically, this TC is used in tables where the INDEX space is
             constantly changing and/or the TimeFilter mechanism is in use.

    typedef ASN1_Unsigned ZeroBasedCounter32Type; 

    /*
             This TC describes an object that stores the value of the
             sysUpTime object at the last time its entry was created.
             
             This can be used for polling applications to determine that an
             entry has been deleted and re-created between polls, causing
             an otherwise undetectable discontinuity in the data.
             
             If sysUpTime is reset to zero as a result of a re-
             initialization of the network management (sub)system, then
             the values of all LastCreateTime objects are also reset.
             However, after approximately 497 days without a re-
             initialization, the sysUpTime object will reach 2^^32-1 and
             then increment to zero; in this case, existing values
             of TimeStamp objects do not change.  This can lead to
             ambiguities in the value of TimeStamp objects.

             to download only those rows changed since a particular time.
             
             
             
             Note that this is not a history mechanism.  Only current values
             of underlying objects are returned; saved instance values
             associated with particular values of sysUpTime are not.
             
             An entry is considered changed if the value of any object in the
             entry changes, if the row is created, or if any object in the
             entry is created or deleted.  Note that deleted entries cannot
             be detected or downloaded.
             
             A time-filtered conceptual table is created by inserting a
             single object of SYNTAX TimeFilter as the first INDEX component
             in a copy of an existing basic conceptual table (i.e., any
             SEQUENCE without a TimeFilter INDEX component).  Thus, for
             each conceptual entry 'I' in the basic table, there exists N
             conceptual entries in the time-filtered version, indexed N.I,
             where 'N' is equal to the value of sysUpTime.
             
             When an application retrieves conceptual instances from a
             time-filtered table, and an INDEX value is provided for the
             TimeFilter INDEX component 'N', the agent will only consider
             returning basic conceptual entries (e.g., 'fooColumn.N.I') if
             any column within the basic conceptual entry has changed since
             sysUpTime 'N'.  If not, the basic conceptual entry will
             be ignored for the particular retrieval operation.
             
             When sysUpTime is equal to zero, this table shall be empty.
             
             One conceptual entry exists for each past value of sysUpTime,
             except that the whole table is purged should sysUpTime wrap.
             
             As an entry in a time-filtered table is updated (i.e., one of
             the columns in the basic conceptual table is changed), new
             conceptual entries are also created in the time-filtered version
             (which still shares the now updated object values with all other
             instances).  The number of unique time-filtered instances that
             are created is determined by the value of sysUpTime at which the
             basic entry was last updated.  One unique instance will exist
             for each value of sysUpTime at the last update time for the row.
             However, a new TimeFilter index instance is created for each new
             sysUpTime value.  The TimeFilter index values not associated
             with entry updates are called duplicate time-filtered instances.
             
             After some deployment experience, it has been determined that
             a time-filtered table is more efficient if the agent
             stops a MIB walk operation by skipping over rows with a
             TimeFilter index value higher than the value in the received
             GetNext/GetBulk request.  That is, instead of incrementing a
             TimeFilter index value, the agent will continue to the next
             
             
             
             object or table.  As a consequence, GetNext or GetBulk
             operations will provide only one pass through a time-filtered
             table.
             
             It is suggested that an agent implement a time-filtered table
             in this manner to improve performance and avoid a MIB walk
             getting stuck in time-filtered tables.  It is, however, still
             acceptable for an agent to implement a time-filtered table in
             the traditional manner (i.e., every conceptual time-filtered
             instance is returned in GetNext and GetBulk PDU responses), and
             management applications must be able to deal with such
             traditional implementations.
             
             See the appendix for further discussion of this textual
             convention.
             
             The following example is provided to demonstrate TimeFilter
             behavior:
             
             Consider the following basic conceptual table, basicFooTable.
             (Note that the basic version of a time-filtered table may not
             actually be defined.)
             
                 basicFooTable:
             
                 basicFooTable ...
                 INDEX { fooIndex }
             
                 BasicFooEntry {
                    fooIndex     Integer32,
                    fooCounts    Counter32
                 }
             
             For this example, the basicFooTable contains two static
             conceptual entries (fooIndex equals '1' and '2'), created at
             time zero.  It also contains one dynamic conceptual entry
             (fooIndex equals '3'), which is created at time '3' and deleted
             at time '7'.
             
             The time-filtered version of the basicFooTable could be defined
             as follows:
             
                 FooTable:
             
                 fooTable ...
                 INDEX { fooTimeMark, fooIndex }
             
                 FooEntry {
             
             
             
                    fooTimeMark  TimeFilter,
                    fooIndex     Integer32,
                    fooCounts    Counter32
                 }
             
             
             Note that entries exist in the time-filtered conceptual table
             only if they actually exist in the underlying (basic) table.
             
             For this example, the fooTable will have three underlying
             basic entries (fooIndex == 1, 2, and 3), with the following
             activity (for sysUpTime equal 0 to 9):
             
                - fooEntry.N.1 is created at time '0' and most recently
                  updated at time '6' to the value '5'.
                - fooEntry.N.2 is created at time '0' and most recently
                  updated at time '8' to the value '9'.
                - fooEntry.N.3 is created at time '3', updated at time '5'
                  to the value '17', and deleted at time '7'.
             
             The following tables show the values that would be returned for
             MIB walk operations with various TimeFilter values, done at
             different times.  An application issues a retrieval request at
             time 'T', with a TimeFilter value, 'N' (typically set to a lower
             value, such as the value of sysUpTime at the last polling cycle).
             
             The following values would be returned in a MIB walk of
             fooCounts.N if T equals '0' and N equals '0':
             
                  fooCounts.N.I    Value
                  ==========================
                  fooCounts.0.1    0
                  fooCounts.0.2    0
             
              Note that nothing is returned for fooCounts.0.3, since that
              entry does not exist at sysUpTime equals '0'.
             
             The following values would be returned in a full (traditional) MIB
             walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '3' and N equals '0':
             
                  fooCounts.N.I    Value
                  =======================
                  fooCounts.0.1    0
                  fooCounts.0.2    0
                  fooCounts.0.3    0
                  fooCounts.1.3    0
                  fooCounts.2.3    0

              Note that there are no instances for T equals 1 or 2 for the
              first two values of N, as these entries did not change
              since they were created at time '0'.
             
              Note that the current value for 'fooCounts.N.3' is returned
              here, even for values of N less than '3' (when the entry was
              created).  The agent only considers the current existence of an
              entry in the TimeFilter algorithm, not the time when the entry
              was created.
             
              Note that the instances 'fooCounts.0.3', 'fooCounts.1.3',
              and 'fooCounts.2.3' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the
              agent in a MIB walk.
             
             The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)
             MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '6' and N equals '3':
             
                  fooCounts.N.I    Value
                  =======================
                  fooCounts.3.1    5
                  fooCounts.3.3    17
                  fooCounts.4.1    5
                  fooCounts.4.3    17
                  fooCounts.5.1    5
                  fooCounts.5.3    17
                  fooCounts.6.1    5
             
               Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.2' are returned,
               since it has not changed since time '3'.
             
               Note that all instances except 'fooCounts.5.3' and
               'fooCounts.6.1' are duplicates and can be suppressed by the
               agent in a MIB walk.
             
             The following values would be returned in a full (traditional)
             MIB walk of fooCounts.N if T equals '9' and N equals '6':
             
                  fooCounts.N.I    Value
                  =======================

                  fooCounts.6.2    9
                  fooCounts.7.2    9
                  fooCounts.8.2    9
             
               Note that no instances for entry 'fooCounts.N.3' are returned,
               since it was deleted at time '7'.
             
               Note that instances 'fooCounts.6.2' and 'fooCounts.7.2'
             
             
             
               are duplicates and can be suppressed by the agent in a MIB

    /*
             This data type is used to communicate with a modem or a
             
             
             
             serial data switch.  A ControlString contains embedded
             commands to control how the device will interact with the
             remote device through the serial interface.  Commands are
             represented as two-character sequences beginning with
             the '^' character.
             
             The following commands are recognized by the device (note
             that command characters are case sensitive):
             
                ^s  Send string that follows, which is terminated by the
                    next command or the end of string.
                ^c  Delay for the number of seconds that follows.  Toss
                    out any data received rather than store it in a
                    buffer for parsing.
                ^t  Set timeout to the value represented by the decimal
                    digits that follow.  The default timeout is 20
                    seconds.  Note that this timeout may be overridden
                    by a smaller serialTimeout configured for the
                    associated serial interface (see serialConfigTable).
                ^w  Wait for the reply string that follows, which is
                    terminated by the next command or the end of string.
                    Partial and case-insensitive matching is applied, i.e.,
                    if the reply string (any case combination) is found
                    anywhere in the received string, then the a match is
                    found.  If the current timeout elapses without a match,
                    then the remaining control string is ignored.
                ^!  The ^ character.
                ^d  Delay the number of seconds specified by the decimal
                    digits that follow.
                ^b  Send break for the number of milliseconds specified by
                    the decimal digits that follow.  If no digits follow,
                    break will be enforced for 250 milliseconds by default.
             
             The following ASCII control characters may be inserted into
             the '^s' send string or the '^w' reply string:
             
                ^@    0x00
                ^A    0x01
                 ..
                ^M    0x0D
                 ..
                ^Z    0x1A
                ^[    0x1B
                ^    0x1C
                ^]    0x1D
                ^^    0x1E
                ^_    0x1F
             
             
             
             
             Binary data may also be inserted into the data stream.  The
             control sequence for each byte of binary data is ^0x##, where
             ## is the hexadecimal representation of the data byte.  Two
             ASCII characters (0-9, a-f, A-F) must follow the '^0x'
             control prefix.  For example, '^0x0D^0x0A' is interpreted as a
             carriage return followed by a line feed.

             that child node is not extendable.  This is termed 'limited

             mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and

             to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol
             and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to
             recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate
             network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses
             in this protocol.  If this bit is set, the agent will
             recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and

             tables with these protocols.

             values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent
             with respect to this protocol.  Note that since row creations
             usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these
