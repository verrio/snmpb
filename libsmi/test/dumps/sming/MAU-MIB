            true state is unknown; for example, when it is
            being initialized.
            
            A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
            functional, operates, and passes signals to its
            attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
            its specification.
            
            A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
            idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
            if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
            link type MAUs.  The state of
            rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.
            
            A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
            condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
            as though it were powered down or not connected.
            The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
            rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
            when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
            state will remove power from the AUI.
            
            Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
            resets the MAU in the same manner as a
            power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
            second would.  The agent is not required to
            return the value reset (6).
            
            Setting this variable to the value
            operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
            causes the MAU to assume the respective state
            except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
            to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the

            For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
            this indicates whether or not loopback is
            detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
            attribute persists between packets for MAU types
            AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.
            
            The value other(1) is returned if the
            mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.
            
            The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
            true state is unknown; for example, when it is
            being initialized.  At power-up or following a
            reset, the value of this attribute will be
            unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
            these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
            transmission during which no collision is
            detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
            returns to IDL after a transmission and there
            has been no collision during the transmission
            then loopback will be detected.  The value of
            this attribute will only change during
            non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
            10BASE-FP MAUs.
            
            
            
            For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
            match the states within the respective link
            integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
            24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [IEEE802.3].
            Any MAU which implements management of
            auto-negotiation will map remote fault
            indication to remote fault.
            
            The value available(3) indicates that the link,
            light, or loopback is normal.  The value
            notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
            or no loopback.
            
            The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
            has been detected at the remote end of the link.
            This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
            End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
            faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
            The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
            and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
            remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
            is identified in the remote signaling protocol.
            
            The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
            invalid signal has been received from the other
            end of the link.  invalidSignal(6) applies only
            to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.
            
            Where an IEEE Std 802.3-2002 clause 22 MII
            is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
            (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
            maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
            zero in the link status bit (reference section
            22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
            notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
            takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).
            
            Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
            Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote
            Fault (RF1 and RF2) bit values for Offline to
            offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and
            Auto-Negotiation Error to autoNegError(11).";

            For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
            this indicates whether or not loopback is
            detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
            attribute persists between packets for MAU types
            AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.
            
            The value other(1) is returned if the
            mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 18.
            
            The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
            true state is unknown; for example, when it is
            being initialized.  At power-up or following a
            reset, the value of this attribute will be
            unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
            these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
            transmission during which no collision is
            detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
            returns to IDL after a transmission and there
            has been no collision during the transmission
            then loopback will be detected.  The value of
            
            
            
            this attribute will only change during
            non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
            10BASE-FP MAUs.
            
            For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
            match the states within the respective link
            integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
            24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [IEEE802.3].
            Any MAU which implements management of
            auto-negotiation will map remote fault
            indication to remote fault.
            
            The value available(3) indicates that the link,
            light, or loopback is normal.  The value
            notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
            or no loopback.
            
            The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
            has been detected at the remote end of the link.
            This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
            End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
            faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
            The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
            and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
            remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
            is identified in the remote signaling protocol.
            The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
            invalid signal has been received from the other
            end of the link.  invalidSignal(6) applies only
            to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.
            
            Where an IEEE Std 802.3-2002 clause 22 MII
            is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
            (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
            maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
            zero in the link status bit (reference section
            22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
            notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
            takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).
            
            Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
            Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and
            RF2 bit values for Offline to offline(10), Link
            Failure to remoteFault(5) and Auto-Negotiation
            Error to autoNegError(11).
            
            For 10 Gb/s, the enumerations map to the states

            as follows:
              NoFault maps to the enumeration 'available(3)'
              LocalFault maps to the enumeration
                'notAvailable(4)'
              RemoteFault maps to the enumeration
                'remoteFault(5)'
            The enumerations 'pmdLinkFault(12)',
            'wisFrameLoss(13)', 'wisSignalLoss(14)',
            'pcsLinkFault(15)', 'excessiveBER(16)', and
            'dxsLinkFault(17)' and 'pxsLinkFault(18)' should
            be used instead of the enumeration
            'notAvailable(4)' where the reason for the local

            MDIO Interface.  Where multiple reasons for the
            local fault state can be identified only the

            A value that uniquely identifies the set of
            possible IEEE 802.3 types that the MAU could be.
            The value is a sum which initially takes the
            value zero.  Then, for each type capability of
            this MAU, 2 raised to the power noted below is
            added to the sum. For example, a MAU which has
            the capability to be only 10BASE-T would have a
            value of 512 (2**9).  In contrast, a MAU which
            supports both 10Base-T (full duplex) and
            100BASE-TX (full duplex) would have a value of
            ((2**11) + (2**16)) or 67584.
