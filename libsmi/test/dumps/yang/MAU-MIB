          The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in

          6.
          
          
          
          The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
          true state is unknown; for example, when it is

          its specification.
          
          A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to

          link type MAUs.  The state of
          rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.
          
          A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
          condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter,
          as though it were powered down or not connected.
          The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the

          resets the MAU in the same manner as a
          power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
          second would.  The agent is not required to
          return the value reset(6).
          
          Setting this variable to the value
          operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
          causes the MAU to assume the respective state,

          of the enumerated values.
          
          The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in
          a state other than one of the states 2 through
          6.
          
          The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
          true state is unknown; for example, when it is
          being initialized.
          
          A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
          functional; it operates, and passes signals to its
          attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
          its specification.
          
          A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
          idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
          if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
          link type MAUs.  The state of
          ifMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.
          
          A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
          condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter,
          as though it were powered down or not connected.
          The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
          ifMauJabberState and ifMauMediaAvailable objects
          when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
          state will remove power from the AUI.
          
          Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
          resets the MAU in the same manner as a
          power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
          second would.  The agent is not required to
          return the value reset(6).
          
          Setting this variable to the value
          operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
          causes the MAU to assume the respective state,
          except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
          to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the
          shutdown state.";
